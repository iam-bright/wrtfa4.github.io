		<h2> Brief History </h2>
		<p> First appearing in 1887, the story of iconic detective duo of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson has thrilled the world with spectacle and awe for the adventures that they both encounter and the crime mysteries they solve. After being introduced to the world by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over a hundred and twenty-five years ago, the World’s Greatest Detective, Sherlock Holmes is still very much alive. The TV and Movie remakes of the original story arch has enjoyed its fair share of praise and criticism for their different approaches to the original plot. This paper evaluates a new sensations-familiarity framework of hedonic media products and uses it to investigate the economic potential of remakes, a unique type of movie brand extension and widely used phenomenon in the global movie industry. I will explore the recent history of remakes with a case study on Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes movie and BBC’s Sherlock TV series.

			 Sherlock Holmes may not have been the first private detective, but he was the first to inspire such interest, admiration, and imitation. He and Dr. Watson are considered heroes by many because of the inspirational qualities that can be found in the characters and their stories. “Readers love the Holmes stories and the two central characters. Audiences idolize them, live through them, believe in them, and recreate them.” <a href="conclusion.html#end">(Porter 81)</a>. They need such heroes who can solve any problem or resolve any mystery, no matter how difficult or impossible it seems. The reception history of Sherlock Holmes, the most famous creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the renewal and re-creation of the character through film and television have varied enormously with the waxing and waning popularity and shifting interpretation of the Victorian period. I will only be discussing the two most recent remakes; Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows directed by Guy Ritchie and BBC’s Sherlock TV series directed by Steven Moffat.

		<h2> What is a Remake? </h2>
		<p>Remakes are a special type of brand extension in that they retell an existing narrative in the same modality in which it has been told before. Usually remakes are pure adaptations of the original ones, but they can differ from the plot of the original work. Remakes can have altered features which will consist of characters, scenes, dialogues, location etc. In particular, Guy Ritchie’s interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in the movie was a bold, action-packed hero played by Robert Downey Jr, fighting villains and saving the world in the 1890s. And then there is the BBC TV series where Benedict Cumberbatch plays a savant like Sherlock who is quick to embrace gadgets and modern technology – anything that can help him get closer to catching the bad guys <a href="conclusion.html#end">(Bhoraskar)</a>.
