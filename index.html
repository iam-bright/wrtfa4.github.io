		<p>First appearing in 1887, the story of iconic detective duo of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson has thrilled the world with spectacle and awe for the adventures that they both encounter and the crime mysteries they solve. After being introduced to the world by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over a hundred and twenty-five years ago, the World’s Greatest Detective, Sherlock Holmes is still very much alive. The TV and Movie remakes of the original story arch has enjoyed its fair share of praise and criticism for their different approaches to the original plot. This paper evaluates a new sensations-familiarity framework of hedonic media products and uses it to investigate the economic potential of remakes, a unique type of movie brand extension and widely used phenomenon in the global movie industry. I will explore the recent history of remakes with a case study on Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes movie and BBC’s Sherlock TV series.</p>

					<p>Exactly the sort of updated, retrofitted, anachronistic flight machine you'd anticipate from the film's trailers, The Movie Sherlock Holmes is 75 percent hi-tech, self-satisfied brio, and a quarter actual storytelling, and it may be exactly your attitude towards deductive narrative that determines your tolerance for it. Ritchie’s Holmes lives in Doyle’s times. The horse-drawn carriages, old-fashioned clothes and hats and the sepia tones paint the picture of Doyle’s London. <a href="history.html">Read More...</a></p>

					<p>Moffat’s Sherlock, on the other hand, lives in the fast, upbeat London of 2012. The character’s travel in taxis, wear jeans talk on their iPhones, and John Watson even has a blog where he shares their investigative adventures with the public. However, recall that when Doyle wrote his Sherlock Holmes stories, he did not intend it to be a historical piece or a costume drama. This is why this remake of the original story by Doyle decided to shift the time period from the Victorian-era crime investigator to a more modern representation. <a href="history.html">Read More...</a></p>
