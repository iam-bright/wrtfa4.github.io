			Like other brand extensions, remakes are of limited risk for consumers and offer audiences familiar ‘branded’ attractions as a result of their established characters and story. However, their potential to offer sensations in the form of using novel story elements, introducing new characters, or adding new sensory dimensions is systematically limited, which should reduce their hedonic attractiveness for consumers and imply an economic disadvantage compared to unbranded films as well as other types of movie brand extensions <a href="conclusion.html#end">(Sood and Dreze 354)</a>. It might be unclear whether the familiarity effect of remakes is generally strong enough to dominate this limited sensation potential. I will empirically address this question by analyzing how the Sherlock Holmes remakes performed financially in terms of both revenues and risk.

		<p> Despite taking two different approaches to the original storyline, they still retain the fundamental features that the audience has grown to love about the Sherlock franchise. In the movie, Guy Ritchie present Holmes as a big-screen action hero, but the time period, the costumes, and settings are familiarly 19th century. Even the BBC’s series of a contemporary, young, technologically adept Holmes still retains such familiar trappings as the original characters, 221B Baker Street, and Holmes’ cape-like, flowing overcoat, which has generated its own fan base <a href="conclusion.html#end">(Porter 94)</a>. In the original story, Doyle’s Holmes is not based on the past, but in the present, and is in fact shown to be a man of science, gleefully using any new invention or discovery that may help him solve a case. Incidentally, this is picked up by both Ritchie – with his Sherlock shown driving the Ford Model T in a scene – and Moffat – with his Sherlock using SMS, GPS navigation and any other technology that can help. “However, while forensics might have seemed cutting edge to the readers of 1890, Holmes driving the Model T is merely a funny scene in Game of Shadows.” <a href="conclusion.html#end">(Bhoraskar)</a>. The horse-drawn carriages are seen as quaint and old-fashioned in 2012; they were a way of life in 1890 just like GPS and mobile phones are in 2012. The 2012 audience reaction to Moffat’s Sherlock, then is perhaps closer to what the 1890 audience reaction to Doyle might have been.</p>

		<h2> Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows </h2>
		<p> Exactly the sort of updated, retrofitted, anachronistic flight machine you'd anticipate from the film's trailers, The Movie Sherlock Holmes is 75 percent hi-tech, self-satisfied brio, and a quarter actual storytelling, and it may be exactly your attitude towards deductive narrative that determines your tolerance for it. Ritchie’s Holmes lives in Doyle’s times. The horse-drawn carriages, old-fashioned clothes and hats and the sepia tones paint the picture of Doyle’s London.</p>

		<h2> BBC Sherlock </h2>
			<p>
			 Moffat’s Sherlock lives in the fast, upbeat London of 2012. The character’s travel in taxis, wear jeans talk on their iPhones, and John Watson even has a blog where he shares their investigative adventures with the public. However, recall that when Doyle wrote his Sherlock Holmes stories, he did not intend it to be a historical piece or a costume drama. This is why this remake of the original story by Doyle decided to shift the time period from the Victorian-era crime investigator to a more modern representation.
